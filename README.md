# ✅ Task Manager

Simple console-based task management application built in Python.

## 💡 Why I Built This

This was my second OOP project. After learning to structure data with classes, I wanted to explore how to manage and update object states — like marking tasks as complete — while keeping code modular and clean.

## 🛠 Features

- Add tasks with optional descriptions  
- List all tasks  
- List completed tasks  
- Mark tasks as completed  
- Remove tasks by number  
- Save tasks to a `.txt` file  
- Clear console after each action *(planned enhancement)*

## 🔧 Tech & Concepts

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): encapsulation, methods, attributes  
- CLI-based logic: input loops, state tracking  
- File I/O for saving tasks  
- Modular code design (SRP mindset)
